## Project Description

I will build a 2D RPG game using HTML5, CSS and vanilla javascript. It only works on a computer  It only works on a computer, not a tablet or smart phone. When the user arrives to the page, they will be prompted with instructions and a button to start the game. The character is a dwarf and the enemy a troll. The dwarf can be controlled with the up, down, right, and left arrows and can swing a battle ax with the enter button. The objective is to reach an endpoint, a door out of the level. If you vanquish the troll, you can then exit the level. All images will be procured from open-sources.




TBD
